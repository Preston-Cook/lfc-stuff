# Basic Python Lesson
---

Hey, guys! If this is your first time programming, congrats on taking the first step to learning something really cool! If you're more experienced, it's great to have you too! 

Before we start, it's important to make sure we have all the proper software to run the programs we'll be creating.

### Installation


*Step 1*

Go to [Python's Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python on your machine.


*Step 2*

Go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download the latest version of VS Code--the most popular text-editor in the programming space. 


*Step 3*

Open VS Code and click on the extensions section on the left side of the editor. Search for "Python." Click on the version published by Microsoft and install it on your computer. The extension is small, so this should probably only take a miniute... maybe less. 


*Step 4*

Download the file ending in .ipynb from this repository onto your machine and open it in VS Code. You should be prompted to install a Jupyter Kernel. Once prompted, select install. 


*Step 5*

Have fun! :)
